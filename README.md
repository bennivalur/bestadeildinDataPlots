# Besta deildin data plots

## Disclaimer
Data is manually entered from the reports Besta deildin publishes on their twitter account.  That data comes from Wyscout.  So some data entering errors might be present.  There is the option to uncomment a section in runMe.py that replaces the manually entered xG values with the actual reviewed values from Wyscout, provided by an insider in the league.

## runMe.py
Set what variable you want to plot at the top of the script and run to plot that variable against the same variable conceded.
